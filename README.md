# Hi, I’m Abdelrhman 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me  
I’m a Computer Engineering graduate from Birzeit University (B.Sc., July 2025), passionate about software development, computer vision, and backend systems. I thrive on learning new technologies quickly and enjoy working on innovative and collaborative projects that solve real-world challenges.

## 🔭 Recent Work & Interests  
- Built an **AI-based Traffic Control & Violation Detection System** using YOLOv8, OpenCV, and FastAPI.  
- Worked on real-time object tracking, OCR for license plate recognition, and MongoDB-based logging.  
- Developed responsive dashboards with React and Tailwind to visualize live traffic analytics.  
- Exploring advanced ML, LLMs, and smart systems integration in real-world environments.

## 🚀 Featured Projects  
### Smart Traffic Violation Detection  
- Detected vehicles and red-light violations using YOLOv8 + SORT on live video streams  
- Applied OCR for license plate recognition and automatic alert generation  
- Stored events in MongoDB and served data through a FastAPI backend  
- Reached 86% detection accuracy and demonstrated improved intersection flow

### Personal Portfolio & Interactive UI  
- Created an animated, responsive HTML/CSS/JS profile with interactive cards and motion effects  
- Integrated personal achievements, certificates, and CV sections  
- Deployed on GitHub Pages with clean UI/UX using TailwindCSS
